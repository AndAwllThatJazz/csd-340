    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <h2>Chapter1: The boy who took CSD 340</h2>
    <p class="intro">I'm very ecited to be finishing up my Computer Information Systems Degree at <span id="bellevue">__________</span> University. CSD-340 is the last 
        course I need to take before I matriculate. It will (likely) be my last degree, but certainly not my first.
    </p>
    <p>In 2016, I graduated from the University of Central <span id="missouri">__________</span> with degrees in French and in Music. I can't say that I regret my initial
        undergraduate studies, but I do wish sometimes that I had picked more lucrative fields. As far as French goes, I'd always had a knack
        for speaking it (and the other romantic languages) and when my guidance counselors/advisors said it would pay off in the form of a job
        as an interpreter and/or translator, I thought I was set. Unfortunately for my future, most French speakers in the corporate world are 
        already fluent in English. To be a successful French interpreter, it is necessary to add additional languages to your lingual 
        portfolio such as Arabic, Russian, Mandarin, or another language that compliments your skills. I wasn't in the market to learn 
        another language but I had already done Study Abroad in France and was basically done with the degree, so it only made sense to 
        finish it out.
    </p>
    <p>
        My other natural talent was music. From a young age, I'd always taken to playing musical instruments, so my mother had me enrolled in 
        piano lessons at 11 and clarinet lessons at 13. I took to the field like a fish to water. <span class="sentence">I played and competed
        on Clarinet at the state and national level with the thought that I might make a living as a performer who plays on film scores; 
        that was always the dream.</span> Little did I know that the world of professional orchestras would be so small and <span id="competitive">__________</span> 
        (on one of the most common instruments, no less). Besides, with the way the world is today, I'd probably have to have a roster of 
        private students just to make ends meet; great if you love it, but I've never been much of a teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, here I am, pursuing yet another Bachelor's degree: Computer Information Systems. Luckily for me, during my time at University
        and my first couple jobs afterwards, I've developed an affinity for databases and organizing data and information into efficient
        and navigable systems. While I started pursuing this additional degree out of necessity, I'm glad that I did. It is particularly
        satisfying to see the course concepts I've seen discussed play a part in the work that I do. While I already have quite a bit of 
        experience with HTML/CSS/<span id="javascript">__________</span> work, I'm excited to see what I can learn from this course to further improve my skillset.
